<h1>Now</h1>

<br>Here is what I'm up to lately:
<br>
<ul>
<li>In June my wife gave birth to our adorable son Brendan! It's been a wild ride so far. I'm adjusting to being a parent and still figuring out what this new phase of life looks like. It's been incredible so far.</li>
<li>I'm trying to be more sustainable. This is true in many aspects of my life but especially in computing. Most recently me and a friend hosted  WattWise Game Jam [1], a game jam where a central judging criteria was energy consumed by the game. I also developed a hardware energy-use monitor to track how much power a computer uses with millisecond precision.</li>
<li>I'm cycling around a lot, usually for commuting. It's in part for sustainability, part because I don't believe cars are a good solution for around-town transportation, and part because I enjoy interacting with people as I ride. It's great fun. I've written more on this on my Cycling page.</li>
<li>My wife and I recently bought a town house in North Raleigh! We moved in in July of 2022. It's inside the city limits so I have been able to interact with the politics in the city, especially cycling advocacy groups and the Bicycle and Pedestrian Advisory Committee.</li>
<li>I've recently been rediscovering Orthodox Christianity, after a number of years of not practicing. I have found that many of my issues with Christianity were rather with the secular understanding of Christianity, largely due to the influence of Protestantism and Roman Catholicism, and they are not applicable to the Orthodox church's teachings.</li>
