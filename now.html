<h1>Now</h1>

<br>Here is what I'm up to lately:
<br>
<ul>
<li>I'm trying to be more sustainable. This is true in many aspects of my life but especially in computing. I'm currently working with some friends on ways to track energy use of programs and correlating the energy consumption with software profiling.</li>
<li>I'm cycling around a lot, usually for commuting. It's in part for sustainability, part because I don't believe cars are a good solution for around-town transportation, and part because I enjoy interacting with people as I ride.</li>
<li>My wife and I recently bought a town house in North Raleigh! We moved in in July of 2022. It's inside the city limits so I have been able to interact with the politics in the city.</li>
<li>I've recently been rediscovering Orthodox Christianity, after a number of years of not practicing. I have found that many of my issues with Christianity were rather with the secular understanding of Christianity, largely due to the influence of Protestantism and Roman Catholicism, and they are not applicable to the Orthodox church's teachings.</li>
<li>My wife and I are expecting a baby in June of 2024! I am nervous and excited, and looking forward to being a father.</li>
<ul/>
