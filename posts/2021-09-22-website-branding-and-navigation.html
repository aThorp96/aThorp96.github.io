<h1>On Website Branding and Navigation: Contextualizing Online Arguments</h1>

<br>I recently read a post about website branding and navigation.
<br>The author discussed his experiments "branding", such as banners and links to other sites/pages.
<br>Ultimately he came to the conclusion that "branding" is critical for navigation.
<br>That is to say the banners and footers are necessary because they act as a visual language we unknowingly use to navigate websites.
<br>Readers have a hard time finding their way around without this visual language, if the author is correct.
<br>However I this conclusion is incomplete.
<br>
<br>The real answer, I believe, is context.
<br>When you read a post, especially an opinion piece or blog post, context is critical to assessing the authors argument.
<br>Immediately after reading an article I will often navigate to other posts or the "about me" page in order to better understand the perspective of the author and in turn the context of the post.
<br>Is the privacy article being written by a consumer or by an expert?
<br>Is the author financially invested in your response to the article (see: every cryptocurrency post every)?
<br>That difference may, or even should, make you reevaluate an argument, no matter how strong.
<br>
<br>Ironically, this argument is strengthened by reading more about the author's website; he doesn't have many blog posts to link together, he has a number of subdomains and hosted services.
<br>With that context, I understood better that "contextualizing an argument" may be less important to the author than simply navigating, but without that context, I could never have fully understood his argument.
