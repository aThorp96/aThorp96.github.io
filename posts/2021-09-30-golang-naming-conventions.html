<h1>Golang Naming Conventions</h1>

<br>I've been working with Golang off and on since college. When I first
<br>encountered the language I knew Java and C, and I was thrilled to be working
<br>with a language that felt modern yet familiar. The language's opinions were
<br>sensible but things like type-inference, simple concurrency, and duck-typing
<br>were refreshing. I no longer feel this way
<br>
<br>Now, I feel like every time I encounter an opinionated decision in Golang's
<br>design or prescriptive style I disagree with it. Not just "I don't like this"
<br>so much as "I don't understand how this could be a positive choice". The
<br>perfect example of this is actually a part of the Go Official Styleâ„¢ [1]:
<br>
<br>Initialisms are, by standard, consistently cased. So if you have a VOIP ID or
<br>Target Group ARN they want you to write it VOIPID and TargetGroupARN instead of
<br>VoipID TargetGroupArn. This degrades the readability of the variables and the
<br>ability to break the var into words. When you camel case initialisms you are
<br>able to intuitively break up VoipId into VOIP and ID. This is more difficult
<br>with VOIPID or voipid. God forbid you need to do so programmatically.
<br>Without a dictionary of initialisms most programs would break the first example
<br>into the words "V", "O", "I", "P", "I", and "D". Us humans have a dictionary
<br>of initialisms in our brain, so all we need to do is try and figure out where
<br>to place the delimeter.
<br>
<br>Of course Golang has a solution for this: mix and match! Use lowercase for one
<br>word and UPPERCASE for the next. Easy! voipID and VOIPid (in the case of a
<br>public field) are easy and only come at the cost of inconsistent casing.
<br>Of course this breaks down if you have three in a row.
<br>
<br>> VoipXmlId
<br>> VOIPXMLID
<br>> VOIPxmlID
<br>> voipXMLid
<br>
<br>Someone please tell me what could possibly be a defense for this. I can't
<br>fathom what we gain from this casing convention.
